InspectorCalculator
===================

Allows calculation inside Unity3D inspector fields

Ever wished you could do simple math in an inspector field?  
Ever wished that scale of 2.42 could easily be multiplied up by 1.5?  
Ever wished that object were nudged over by 10 * sin( pi / 3 ) ?  
Well now all of this is possible and more!

Simply select any text field in an inspector and push ctrl-shift-e ( command-shift-e on mac ) or select Evaluate from the Edit menu.

The value in the field will be copied into a new Calculator Window.  
You can then type a simple mathematical expression into the window and press return.  
The window will close and the result will be placed back in your original field, just like magic!  
Well, Magic driven by lots and lots of FLOPS.<br>

Currently supports these functions, with any others easily wrappable
sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, pow, exp, log, ln, +, *, -, /, % and more

To install-
just copy the contents of the Unity4/Assets folder into your project's Assets folder
